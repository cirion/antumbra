Antumbra closes "for repairs" the day after it opened. Irate partiers complain outside before making the long trek south to the glitzy clubs of downtown Seattle. When Antumbra re-opens in a week's time, it stuns the leisure class with matchless decor and entertainment. Before long it becomes the essential place to see and be seen.

Local conspiracy theorists persist in wondering what "repairs" were done, and try to link the club to a Mitsuhama skyscraper starting construction next door. No connection is ever proven, and the speculators remain grasping at straws.

Among those few in the know, however, there's another story: a story of a runner who broke a contract and saved thousands of lives. A runner sure to be despised by all the Mr. Johnsons of Seattle, but who has earned the undying gratitude of powerful allies. This runner ran into the shadows and brought the light.
